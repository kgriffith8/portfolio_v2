        <h2 class="main--heading">the goal of this calculator</h2>
        <p class="main--paragraph">I believe that a healthy body brings a healthy mind and in this day and age where we have such an abundance of not just options of food, but means of research and training, finding clear and straight to the point information can be difficult. There is no sales pitch attached to this application, aside from me encouraging you to take these numbers, view recipies and visualize what these calories look like and determine how you can meet your daily needs. Currently, this program is set up to assume you are exercising 3-5 times a week (the recommended amount) and for at least an hour during each exercise session. The default caloric output you recieve is assuming you are interested in a healthy weight cut. If you want to maintain your current weight it is recommended to add 250-300 more calories based on where you gauge your own body's responsiveness to food. If you are looking to gain weight in a clean and productive manner, it is recommended you add 350-500 more calories to your output. This is a work in progress application that will see many changes over time with the ultimate goal of providing a user friendly, intuitive and coherent way to help educate users on what their diet should look like should they choose to make a change.</p>
